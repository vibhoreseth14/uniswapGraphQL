# uniswapGraphQL

The Graph is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying data from blockchains, starting with Ethereum. It makes it possible to query data that is difficult to query directly.
Graphql is a query language for APIs.

Used GraphQL Query API that is used for the Graph Protocol to access the pool Data of UNI/WETH pair and drawn conclusions from it.

I have used virtual python environment created for the notebook ,
you can also make same using pyhton 3.9 versiona nd requirements.txt file for essential packages.
Then notebook is easily viewed in ide like Pycharm or Google Collab notebooks.

Please take time to paly around with GraphQL Query API on their site before project.

Thanks a lot!
